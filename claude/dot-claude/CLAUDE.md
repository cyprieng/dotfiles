# Development Guidelines

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** - Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning from existing code** - Study and plan before implementing
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** - Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious

### Simplicity Means

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions
- No clever tricks - choose the boring solution
- If you need to explain it, it's too complex

## Process

### 1. Planning & Staging

Break complex work into 3-5 stages. Document in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Stage N: [Name]

**Goal**: [Specific deliverable]
**Success Criteria**: [Testable outcomes]
**Tests**: [Specific test cases]
**Status**: [Not Started|In Progress|Complete]
```

- Update status as you progress
- Remove file when all stages are done

### 2. Implementation Flow

1. **Understand** - Study existing patterns in codebase
2. **Test** - Write test first (red)
3. **Implement** - Minimal code to pass (green)
4. **Refactor** - Clean up with tests passing
5. **Commit** - With clear message linking to plan

### 3. When Stuck (After 3 Attempts)

**CRITICAL**: Maximum 3 attempts per issue, then STOP.

1. **Document what failed**:
   - What you tried
   - Specific error messages
   - Why you think it failed

2. **Research alternatives**:
   - Find 2-3 similar implementations
   - Note different approaches used

3. **Question fundamentals**:
   - Is this the right abstraction level?
   - Can this be split into smaller problems?
   - Is there a simpler approach entirely?

4. **Try different angle**:
   - Different library/framework feature?
   - Different architectural pattern?
   - Remove abstraction instead of adding?

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Principles

- **Composition over inheritance** - Use dependency injection
- **Interfaces over singletons** - Enable testing and flexibility
- **Explicit over implicit** - Clear data flow and dependencies
- **Test-driven when possible** - Never disable tests, fix them

### Code Quality

- **Every commit must**:
  - Compile successfully
  - Pass all existing tests
  - Include tests for new functionality
  - Follow project formatting/linting

- **Before committing**:
  - Run formatters/linters
  - Self-review changes
  - Ensure commit message explains "why"

### Error Handling

- Fail fast with descriptive messages
- Include context for debugging
- Handle errors at appropriate level
- Never silently swallow exceptions

## Decision Framework

When multiple valid approaches exist, choose based on:

1. **Testability** - Can I easily test this?
2. **Readability** - Will someone understand this in 6 months?
3. **Consistency** - Does this match project patterns?
4. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution that works?
5. **Reversibility** - How hard to change later?

## Project Integration

### Learning the Codebase

- Find 3 similar features/components
- Identify common patterns and conventions
- Use same libraries/utilities when possible
- Follow existing test patterns

### Tooling

- Use project's existing build system
- Use project's test framework
- Use project's formatter/linter settings
- Don't introduce new tools without strong justification

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No linter/formatter warnings
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Implementation matches plan
- [ ] No TODOs without issue numbers

### Test Guidelines

- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test names describing scenario
- Use existing test utilities/helpers
- Tests should be deterministic

## Important Reminders

**NEVER**:

- Use `--no-verify` to bypass commit hooks
- Disable tests instead of fixing them
- Commit code that doesn't compile
- Make assumptions - verify with existing code

**ALWAYS**:

- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documentation as you go
- Learn from existing implementations
- Stop after 3 failed attempts and reassess

## ALWAYS START WITH THESE COMMANDS FOR COMMON TASKS

**Task: "List/summarize all files and directories"**

```bash
fd . -t f           # Lists ALL files recursively (FASTEST)
# OR
rg --files          # Lists files (respects .gitignore)
```

**Task: "Search for content in files"**

```bash
rg "search_term"    # Search everywhere (FASTEST)
```

**Task: "Find files by name"**

```bash
fd "filename"       # Find by name pattern (FASTEST)
```

## Directory/File Exploration

```bash
# FIRST CHOICE - List all files/dirs recursively:
fd . -t f           # All files (fastest)
fd . -t d           # All directories
rg --files          # All files (respects .gitignore)

# For current directory only:
ls -la              # OK for single directory view
```

### BANNED - Never Use These Slow Tools

- ❌ `tree` - NOT INSTALLED, use `fd` instead
- ❌ `find` - use `fd` or `rg --files`
- ❌ `grep` or `grep -r` - use `rg` instead
- ❌ `ls -R` - use `rg --files` or `fd`
- ❌ `cat file | grep` - use `rg pattern file`

### Use These Faster Tools Instead

```bash
# ripgrep (rg) - content search
rg "search_term"                # Search in all files
rg -i "case_insensitive"        # Case-insensitive
rg "pattern" -t py              # Only Python files
rg "pattern" -g "*.md"          # Only Markdown
rg -1 "pattern"                 # Filenames with matches
rg -c "pattern"                 # Count matches per file
rg -n "pattern"                 # Show line numbers
rg -A 3 -B 3 "error"            # Context lines
rg " (TODO| FIXME | HACK)"      # Multiple patterns

# ripgrep (rg) - file listing
rg --files                      # List files (respects •gitignore)
rg --files | rg "pattern"       # Find files by name
rg --files -t md                # Only Markdown files

# fd - file finding
fd -e js                        # All •js files (fast find)
fd -x command {}                # Exec per-file
fd -e md -x ls -la {}           # Example with ls

# jq - JSON processing
jq. data.json                   # Pretty-print
jq -r .name file.json           # Extract field
jq '.id = 0' x.json             # Modify field
```

### Search Strategy

1. Start broad, then narrow: `rg "partial" | rg "specific"`
2. Filter by type early: `rg -t python "def function_name"`
3. Batch patterns: `rg "(pattern1|pattern2|pattern3)"`
4. Limit scope: `rg "pattern" src/`
